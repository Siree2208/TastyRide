# TastyRide
In the fast-paced world of food delivery, customers seek an easy, secure, and comprehensive platform that allows them to access multiple restaurant options, browse detailed menus, place orders seamlessly, and receive prompt support. Simultaneously, restaurant owners need a streamlined, reliable way to manage their listings, prices, and promotions, while also engaging directly with customers through reviews, ratings, and FAQ support.

TastyRide addresses these needs by providing a Salesforce-based, restaurant aggregator and food ordering platform that combines robust security with a user-friendly interface. This application enables restaurants to effortlessly update menu items, prices, and offers while customers can explore various dining options, order food, and communicate with the restaurant owners. By integrating a secure, scalable environment with multiple user roles—such as owner, restaurant, and customer logins — TastyRide aims to enhance the online food ordering experience for all stakeholders involved.
